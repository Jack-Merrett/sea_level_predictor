# Sea Level Predictor

Welcome to the Sea Level Predictor project! This project is part of the Data Analysis with Python certification from FreeCodeCamp.

## Introduction

The Sea Level Predictor is a Python project aimed at analyzing and visualizing sea level data to predict future sea level rise. By using Python programming and data analysis techniques, this project aims to create predictive models and visualizations that help understand sea level trends and make predictions for the future.

## Project Instructions

The main objective of the Sea Level Predictor project is to analyze historical sea level data and create predictive models for future sea level rise. The provided dataset contains sea level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The project instructions guide you through the process of loading, analyzing, and visualizing the data, as well as creating predictive linear regression models.

Here's an overview of the tasks covered in this project:

1. Load and preprocess the sea level data using Pandas.
2. Create linear regression models to predict sea levels.
3. Visualize the sea level data and regression models using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Analyze the residuals of the regression models to assess their performance.

## Getting Started

To start working on the Sea Level Predictor project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the project directory.
3. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to complete the tasks.
4. Utilize the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries for data analysis and visualization.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this project, you should have a solid understanding of Python programming, data analysis concepts, and linear regression modeling. Familiarity with the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries is essential, as these tools will be used to analyze and visualize the sea level data.
